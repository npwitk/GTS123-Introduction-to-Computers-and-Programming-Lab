# GTS123: Introduction to Computers and Programming (Laboratory)

This repository contains Python files for **GTS123: Introduction to Computers and Programming**, a one-semester course at SIIT, Thammasat University. The course introduces basic programming concepts and hands-on practice with Python, covering topics such as variables, input/output, control flow (`if`, `else`, loops), data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets), functions, and an introduction to libraries like NumPy for numerical computations.

The repository is organized by weekly lab topics, starting from basic concepts to more advanced topics.

I have also provided practice quizzes for both the midterm and final exams from our year.
